Bias represents the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. A model with high bias tends to oversimplify the problem and may not capture all the relevant information, leading to underfitting. On the other hand, variance represents the variability of the model's predictions when trained on different datasets. A model with high variance is sensitive to the training data and may overfit, meaning it performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. The bias-variance trade-off suggests that there is a trade-off between these two sources of error. As we decrease bias, we increase variance, and vice versa. The goal is to find the right balance that minimizes both bias and variance, resulting in a model that generalizes well to unseen data.",

Another solution is to incentivize healthcare professionals to work in rural areas by offering financial benefits, career advancement opportunities, and support for their professional development. This can help attract and retain healthcare professionals in rural areas, ensuring that residents have access to quality healthcare services. Finally, improving transportation infrastructure in rural areas can also contribute to better access to healthcare.

Additionally, they can also opt for reusable shopping bags instead of accepting single-use plastic bags at stores. By bringing their own bags, they can avoid contributing to the accumulation of plastic waste and help protect the environment.",
